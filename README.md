# XYZ Analytics Regional Sales Analysis
## Problem Statement
Sales teams often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of regional performance, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities and identify resources. This project aims to analyze and visualize regional sales data to uncover trends, evaluate profitability, and support strategic decision-making.
* **Business Questions**
  - Inconsistent revenue and profit performance across U.S. regions
  - Lack of visibility into seasonal swings, top SKUs and channel profitability
  - **Goal: Leverage 5 years of historical data to pinpoint growth levers and optimize strategy**
## Approach
**1. Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Dive into historical sales, margins, products, channels, regions
  - Surface trend, outliers and relationships

**2. Interactive Dashboard:**
  - Build a live view for business users to self-serve insights
  - Enable ad-hoc slicing by time, product, region, channel
